# Insurance Document Comparison System

## Project Summary
The Insurance Document Comparison System is an advanced solution designed to extract, structure, compare, and analyze insurance policy documents. It transforms complex insurance PDFs into structured knowledge representations, enabling precise side-by-side comparisons of coverage details, costs, exclusions, and limitations. The system utilizes natural language processing, knowledge graph technology, and machine learning to provide users with clear insights into policy differences and recommendations tailored to their needs.

## Project Definition
The system follows a comprehensive workflow that includes document ingestion, content extraction, knowledge representation, intelligent comparison, and user-friendly visualization. It structures insurance policy information using either a graph-based approach or custom data storage solutions to maintain relationships between policy elements. The comparison engine aligns matching sections across documents to highlight variations in coverage, costs, and terms while providing explanations in understandable language.

## Project Scope

### In Scope:
- PDF document ingestion, validation, and preprocessing
- Text extraction and structural parsing of insurance documents
- Entity recognition for insurance-specific terminology and values
- Knowledge representation using graph databases or structured JSON/SQL
- Section alignment and comparison across multiple documents
- Identification of coverage differences, limitations, and exclusions
- Interactive visualization of policy comparisons
- User-friendly explanations of complex insurance terms
- Customizable report generation
- AI-powered claims processing automation

### Technical Components:
- Document processing and OCR capabilities
- Insurance-specific ontology and entity extraction
- Comparison algorithms for text and numerical data
- Knowledge graph or structured database for data storage
- API gateway for integration with other systems
- Interactive user interface for visualizing comparisons

### AI Claims Processing:
The system extends beyond document comparison to include intelligent claims processing capabilities. Using the same underlying knowledge representation and NLP technologies, it can automatically extract relevant information from claims documents, verify coverage against policy terms, identify potential fraud indicators, and accelerate the adjudication process. The AI claims component can categorize claims by type, severity, and complexity, routing simple claims for automated processing while flagging complex cases for human review. This reduces processing time, improves consistency in decision-making, and enhances overall customer satisfaction through faster claim settlements.
